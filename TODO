PAPER
- Supplementary figures
    - Scanning selection strenght in dmsC. Figure with relaxation times and another with the visualizations
    - Axis 3 (4) in dmsC visualization
    - Probability vs frequency scatterplot
    - Relaxation times in dmsC and TD model
    - Scatterplot of predictions in TD model (or all models) in traning and test data

CODE
- Organize SD repository
- Test gpmap-tools installation works
- Release gpmap-tools new version on pypi
- Review docs
    - Make sure we have predictions and contrasts in both VCregression and SeqDEFT
    - Think whether to include a section on SD

ADDITIONAL STUFF
- Plot errors of the TD model on the visualization directly
