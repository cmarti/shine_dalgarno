PAPER
- Supplementary figures
    - Scanning selection strenght in dmsC. Figure with relaxation times and another with the visualizations
    - Axis 3 (4) in dmsC visualization
    - Probability vs frequency scatterplot
    - Supp fig for the TD model:
      - training curve of the TD model
      - Scatterplot of predictions in TD model (or all models) in training and test data
      - Relaxation times
      - Visualization of the errors

CODE
- Organize SD repository
- Test gpmap-tools installation works
- Release gpmap-tools new version on pypi
- Review docs
    - Make sure we have predictions and contrasts in both VCregression and SeqDEFT
    - Think whether to include a section on SD

ADDITIONAL STUFF
- Plot errors of the TD model on the visualization directly to find systematic differences
- Visualizations of the pairwise model as well: emphasizes the usefulness of the visualization for model comparison (as the comparison with the TD model)

NOTES
- Remember that we are illustrating the software. Additional stuff should show quantities that we have shown before or illustrate things that we can do with it that are interesting
